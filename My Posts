'Computers never replace Human beings' is true in the sense that computers can't be the reason for unemployment as feared the other way a few decades ago.. in fact computers 'caused' a new section of jobs..

And..yeah... It's a good idea to replace teachers with computers in "DIRECT TEACHING" only as you get more freedom in choosing your own pattern of learning rather than having to come in line with ideas of certain person called 'teacher'

Never felt that 70% of teachers teach expecting their expertise in subject on part of the students too - I mean at the beginning of a lecture? They easily assume that prerequisites are too silly to be discussed.

On the other hand when the material is made available and the student has choice to select what is in line with HER/HIS way of thinking it would be more fruitful.. and anyway who would be "CREATING" the content?

You got it.. again a 'Teacher'... the 'job title' doesn't change but only the 'job description' changes
