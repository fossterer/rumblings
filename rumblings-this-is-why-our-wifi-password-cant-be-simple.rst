This is why our WiFi password can't be simple
-----------------------------------------------

Dear roommates,

I acknowledge that I have troubled you in the past (twice in the 8 month period, eh?) with unforgivingly difficult to type (even remember) devillish piece of string as the password for our WiFi network. You might have wondered why the guy in that room where we gather to play counter-strike puts a long (but not so hard) password even for the temporary network he creates just for the sake of the game. Everyone has password problems and a password.. no I say "passwordS" with a capital S at the end. I am now assuring you that the next password for our WiFi network is going to be tough too.. yeah ruthlessly tough again!

We do need a strong password for our network for that matter every personal account of yours that has an online presence. I say "strong" -- not just "long". Now, what makes a password "strong"?
I can go on reproducing the material I read over the Internet and in books for years but you are no less smarter than I. Are you? I show a quick link (which doesn't explain case-by-case) which revises the points even you might have come across long ago:

Now that you are assured that 'Security is a myth', do you feel like 'what's the point of having a strong password' then? Remember, the physical lock to our doors can be broken too. But we do make it a point to lock everytime we leave the room. Now ask yourselves - 'what's the point'?

Now, let's come to the point of 'password for our WiFi network'. Why should it be secured? For obvious reasons such as -
 Not allowing others use the service (network) which we are paying for
 Feeling too social? Let me give another one
  Not allowing others gain any kind of access to the service which we are using for our purposes - Ask me why it should matter. I ask you to recall how frustrating it was the last time (just one of you) when you found that your laptop kept disconnecting from our WiFi network while mine was fine. You asked me if something was wrong with our router too. Did you get that? Yes, that's me deliberately attacking your laptop and the router at the same time, breaking "just your connection".
  
  I didn't do that the regular way from router's web interface (aka the default way). Acting as just another user in the network where you are, I
  scanned the network
  guessed the router and your system
  crafted 'dissociation/deauthentication packets' and flooded them in the network
so that your system cannot connect to our router as long as I wished.

It's not any difficult as I read and executed the relevant commands in no time. Think of all the script-kiddies around (you can't identify them; they don't wear an ID card). 

By the way, that's an interesting point of research (to me too). Here's a paper I'm reading at this time: 
http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221092095_A_Lightweight_Solution_for_Defending_Against_DeauthenticationDisassociation_Attacks_on_802.11_Networks

Do you think - why would anyone attack you unless you have any interesting information (or you are Batman)? That's not at all the point.
Want me to make a strong case? When I lost my bag 2 months ago while leaving it unattended in an open area, the immediate reaction from a friend like you was - "the person definitely does not find any use with the items in it" and that (s)he would rather discard it away somewhere. But didn't I face a loss?

A loss is a loss regardless of whoever caused it to happen and the actual owner bears it ultimately.
It's not the thief who matters, irrespective of the existence of one at all, it's the one who loses it (Shouldn't we call him/her a 'Loser'?)

Now, since there's no dictatorship prevailing in the room and that I was the one forcing gruesome passwords twice so far upon you, I only ease the procedure that this time you are going to propose the password for the main network and, and, and, and,,,, (drum roll!!)

I setup a Guest network that works with a different password which changes every week

The password for the main network shall not be revealed to anyone who is not paying to stay in this room; only shall that of the 'Guest network' be shared while informing such a user that it would be changed very often.
