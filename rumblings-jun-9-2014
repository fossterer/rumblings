This is the discussion made in relation to the above idea

<fossterer> Hello! I want to create an article under the title "List of Free Software Organisations in India". Does that sound a valid Wikipedia article?
[15:38] <marktraceur> fossterer: Are there enough such organizations that have Wikipedia articles and which are notable to warrant a full seperate list?
[15:39] <fossterer> Currently I am aware of 4 specific organisations with widespread operations across 4 different states. {still typing]
[15:41] <fossterer> Today I observed that there are 3 more which are Indian Governemnt supported yet acting unrelated. I beleive an active directory of such works should be made available at one place and
[15:42] <fossterer> I beleive Wikipedia is one such place which has become a de facto for obtaining information
