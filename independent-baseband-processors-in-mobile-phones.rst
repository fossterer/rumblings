Intersting development - yesterday, I inavertently had to deal with 'something baseband' firmware in my OnePlus One and today while I go through discussion on mailing list about FCC's new regulations to control Wi-Fi operations, I come to know that our mobile phones have an 'additional independent baseband processor' to regulate the wireless frequencies that the phone can operate on! The relevant thread on the mailing list brought up the point that 'these independent baseband processors [...] add a lot of cost to Wi-Fi devices'.

Is anyone here aware of a mobile phone that combines baseband processor with the rest of the firmware - without it being an additional component? Just curious.
