What did they say that day?
------------------
[A series of posts recalling th  past incidents which once appeared so true but now after certain period turn out to be just false opinions. This series doesn't rule out any of them in their entirety but only brings out the truth that they are just (false) "opinions"]

The senior student in bus, while in Vijayawada raised a big apprehension in me when said that MBA is the only way a s/w guy could rise in his career. Now that is only in a place where technology is just a tool and technologists are available too much. It is only a matter of 'Demand-and-supply'. Now after this I have only to make fun of the guy which I'm not interested in thinking of, as of now

Rumblings get truly rumbled:
----------------------------
Is there a Ph.D in Philosophy? If so, who should a candidate impress to earn such a PhD? If one fails to impress his/her advisor or panel memebrs, does it mean that s/he failed? If so, how would s/he define a "success"?

In general, do you "complete" a Phd? or "earn" one rather?

Is comparing bad or good?
-------------------------
( You know what value I confer to this "Good/Bad Labelling" ;) )
Comparing everything to a known thing is normal for human beings. If criticising is based on their observations, even then it shouldn't matter. Yet if they demean something jsut because it copies something other, then I feel they're in trouble doing so since I assume they are ignorant of the idea that "Everything done by humans is just a mimic of things they observe in nature and they are indeed replicating them in their own form of expression". Just the fact that one is so blatantly mimicking someone should in no way be a reason to be demeaned. Ironically, they do themselves are mimicking already established processes of employment or the other. It is only their belief that producing "Art" is greatly different from all their works.

When in contrast people argue that films should be far from the routine line of works the're witnessing, it is only that they're indeed bored of it and are expecting a variation. Why am I recording this??!??!

When certain creators ( Are they really "Creating" anything? :) ) do produce Off-beat works, there they're; people who complain of lack of enertaining element who fail to express what they mean by "entertaining elements". Do I need someone to approve of my writings if I continue to write in this manner? Do I have a target audience? If not, why am I recording these? I beleive a "Writing's" purpose need not be anything; anything, at all. It justs exists for the sole purpose of itself. A writing is just a form of recording of its author's expressions. But y does it need to be created? Why should not it be? It just comes out of the [wordless expression] desperation/urge to be recorded.

Now, why am I recording this? I'm doing it because I intend to record one thing which is in widespread among the world yet many fail to understand their purpose; Also, I see that this is in part due to they never coming across using them and hence don't bother thinking of them; if this reason fails to satisfy your logic, I don't even bother asking you to ignore it and stay happy with your work
