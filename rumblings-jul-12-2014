How to contribute to Wikipedia? (or precisely 'What to')
--------------------------------------------------------

There was this question I came across on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-Indian-movie-whose-plot-Hollywood-has-copied which led me thinking - 'Oh! The confusing movie 'Abhay'(Telugu) I left once was the inspiration(or a 'Direct source', whichever the reader may prefer) for the now mostly acclaimed 'Kill Bill'!! Pity me :P I'm going to look up more about this film (and watch it soon!). Who's my fiend here? Wikipedia & IMDB.

Going to Wikipedia, I got to the correct page only after a few educated guesses; Why 'guess'? Because a similar named film in other Inidian language was being listed as a diret tranlation for this movie which is entirely of a different genre.

Huh! What a sad!
Yayy!! What an opportunity!!!

Better than I put everything in words, I give the 'diff' of my changes here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhay&diff=616649514&oldid=613554050
(Also, I made 2 more edits immediately after that to make my points clearer)

Conclusion: This article may not ask for a conclusion but I want to put a point out to the people looking for 'Ways to Contribute to Open Source(Open knowledge, in this case). You need not be a dedicated contributor to the Wikipedia but as can be seen from my above narration, if you keep doing things you'd find something which would lead you to "the" thing you always wanted to! Keep doing!!
