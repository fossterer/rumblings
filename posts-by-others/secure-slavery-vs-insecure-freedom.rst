The Truth Booth
December 12, 2012 Â·

This is my concern about anarchy. Free association sounds good in theory, and there's no question it's a moral approach to human interaction, but in practice what would happen is some people would freely associate to make slaves of the rest of us. First would come the threat and use of force, and then all the innumerable justifications for it dressed up as laws. Isn't that the essence of what human history has been? First we had the biggest thugs amongst us setting themselves up as a our rulers, and from them grew governments laws, etc, etc.

Nobody imposed the current level of order on us, it arose spontaneously amongst a species where a majority prefer secure slavery to insecure freedom, and a minority of psychopaths are perfectly happy to accommodate the majority. If we destroyed all the governments of the world today, people would have the entire structure reinstated within a decade.
