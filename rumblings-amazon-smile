Amazon Smiles... The new initiative by Amazon.com which promises to donate a portion of your spendings on purchases made at Amazon's website. Looks good at first sight but wait.. Doesn't something sound tricky?? If you are not spending anything more how is it that Amazon is giving away a part of it all of a sudden? Isn't it a loss to amazon.com in itself? If not, then why do you think amazon has to link its donation's to your spendings with them? What is a donation at all?

...in any transaction there is an exchange between two parties and parties will only enter into that transaction or exchange if the reward outweighs the cost....

That HuffingtonPost article does a good work raising valid points. The apparent donation brings a "warm glow" everytime you purchase and this in part instantaneously makes you feel satisfied that you did 'do your part'. This implies you feel less desire to donate to that or any other charity. The prolem can only be seen when you consider the actual figures. Again, as quoted in the article:

...if you wanted to give $50 to a charity you'd have to spend $10,000 through AmazonSmile. $10,000 to Amazon. $50 to charity. It's pretty clear who wins here and I'll give you a hint: It's not the charity....

Right on the point, indeed! In fact, a study I came across in 2014 (I don't remember the source) found that 'people who spend relatively higher money to buy LED bulbs than their counterparts feel gratification feeling that they went to unusual lengths 'to do their part' and hence become lenient on further spendings(read buying junk food, etc.)'. The feeling of "instant gratification" thereby masking up the reality is the key takeaway from here.

I would say 'donate what you want to to the organisations/people directly'. 'Amazon Smiles' or any other corporate initiative can be welcomed; they should be received with teh same warmth that one feels towards a fello human being deciding to donate. It is that "apparent satisfactory feeling" which prevents you from doing the amounts of good that you can in its absence is the one that is not right.
