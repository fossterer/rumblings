Trip this time was to "Snow Skiing" at Boyce Park, Pittsburgh.

This was my first time to a skiing activity - No prior training yet just reached there. Received a quick overview of the general guidelines from an acquaintance. The most important point (which we learned the hard way by the end!) was to "never attempt to lean back" -- That is the surest way to fall down. It seemed alright when heard but things happened in a different way while in the real action.

Trying to fix the ski pads to your shoes itself would be a big deal! While you attempt to get up after fixing one to your leg, it starts taking you away instantly. After too many trials, I learned that one has to do this while staying perpendicular to the slope. Good going so far!

Now the important part - Skiing without losing control. While you are moving fast across the slope, your "instincts" would make you want to lean back as a gesture to control/protect yourself which works the wrong way - remember this was the act which we were advised not to do. That "inner voice" which always prevents you from pursuing what you want to acheive, which always tries to convince you that "this is enough" and "you can't take anymore". Yet you know that you can go that extra mile - now all that you need to do is listen to one side - Do you want to give up OR are you strong enough to do it? You may also want to read on "Akrasia effect". Remember this has nothing to do with your physical strength - you can do it but it is that "inner voice" that tries to discourage you. Win over it! Don't listen to it. Pursue what you want to.

Lesson learned was to "Don't listen to your instincts"! Yeah, it seems counter-intuitive yet that's the way it worked finally.

It might not be just about inner voice as you do come across many such discouragements from the society around everyday in your life asking you to "give up"/"go for the easy way" than trying to fulfill your dreams. Always remember - "Don't listen to that stupid inner voice"
