Subject: Appreciating your efforts and thanking you for the same

Dear awesome engineers,

I always wondered how amazed I feel whenever I think of this great application. I can chat with my whole family and friends and share a stuff in just 2-3 steps rather than spamming as e-mails to everyone I care. I can't more than appreciate this 'Graph Search'... I honestly don't know if it is first of its kind but surely in my experience with Facebook, it is the best of its kind... I said to all my friends.. 'You need to see with an awe those engineers @ Facebook - really interesting guys!'.

The 'Open Graph' API.. The idea is simply superb.. No one in this world can be left felt alone.. This is a truly appreciable initiative to make the entire world's data accessible. Such great ideas can only happen and flourish at such huge corporations with large user base.

This thing called Facebook is all its way into our lives now.. with File Sharing capabilities in Conversations, virtual counterparts of real groups, topic-based (forum-like) groups, games and everything. Whenever I see "your friend is listening to this song on **some app**  ", I think for a moment - 'where is this technology leading us to...'! What a role Facebook is assuming on our lives. A lot of activity of every friend of mine in front of me, all the time, never lets me feel left alone no matter where I am. You opened new ways of sharing information in an unimagined manner ever. If the Internet made the world smaller, Facebook has made it closer.

I hope the engineering marvels continue at the Facebook and all over the world to explore new possibilities

This letter had to come just because it has to be. I always felt a humble urge to show my gratitude (and awe) to this engineering marvel one day or the other. Hence this auspicious day...

:-) :P (Y)
