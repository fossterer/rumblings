SERIOUS NOTE: I myself do not claim to be a hacker.

If you believe that you understand the seriousness and my idea of this post from the above NOTE, go ahead; the rest need not bother about this any further.

Now as I found that I deleted a few links I sent to my friends for opinions, through Whatsapp, I can

#) either ask them to resend them OR
#) deal with it myself!! (because that's the way I can know more about the products/tools I'm using everyday)

I chose the second path

A quick search over the Internet led me to this: http://androidweeds.com/recover-deleted-whatsapp-messages/

**Feeling Surprised** to learn that Whatsapp stores all data as backup here in my phone itself!

I chose the second way because:

- It's offline! ==> No need to upload my personal data anywhere else
                ==> (With the hope that this tool could have been made by a hacker,) I can learn more by peeking into its source code - such as the crypto algorithm used and more!!
