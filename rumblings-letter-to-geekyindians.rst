As most of the participants here are volunteers, it seems viable for us to 'maintain information' as the first productive (and least demanding) action, before we head to handle more mighty tasks.

* Than just being a forum (or as a dedicated part of a forum), GeekyIndians.com should maintain a hierarchical (that can be searched) list of all the online portals of all Indian Government sections/branches/departments

      As a specific case -- 'http://india.gov.in/' is a pretty decent URL but -- 'https://apps.mgov.gov.in/index.jsp' is a terrible URL that is impossible to be guessed. I never knew that this existed at all let alone the probable awareness among citizens that such apps are being provided/supported/sponsored by the Government itself

     At GeekyIndians.com, we can maintain such a list as well as define an active body of volunteers who can solicit the concerned authorities about these issues of 'Discoverability' as the first step.

PS: I hardly used the site and as I return to check if it can serve this suggestion, I see the site is down for now. Hence I am not sure if a forum can handle this; yet I point out this as it is one of those things that causes 'Digital Divide' in the country - Government does its job but no one is aware of their existence;

       FYI I came across the above said URLs just during a random depth-wide search

* In a similar fashion GeekyInidians.com can maintain a list of all open source conventions, conferences an meetings going on in the country. I was only aware of foss.in from many years yet only after coming to know about a few recently (and excited), I learned that foss.in is discontinued to my dismay.
