This is just a comment on an extract from the original article (see below) which speaks of more things than those mentioned here.

Discussions are welcome (while I read the comments below the article).

Glossary:
----------

- Product-based IT companies: Those that make final products to be used (Think of Adobe, Microsoft etc.)
- Service based IT companies: Those that deliver custom IT-based solutions to various other companies/entirely different industries (Think of TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc.)

1. On the effects of media, lack of initiation
As this article http://www.sramanamitra.com/2007/03/03/why-no-product-companies-in-india/ speaks of the issue of lack of product based (IT) companies, I feel I gain more insights into the issue; I beleive this argument can be safely extended to more than the IT industry which of course makes a good case.

The points worth spreading are:

- We look forward to media and form our opinions based on the cases they present (normal for individuals who can't be expected to make survey of everything)

- But at the same time, the media, to gain popularity, keeps promoting just the cases that can cause "sensation" (normal for the media when taken as an "industry"; note that if something is intentionally ignored of the media industry is "social responsibility" which I cannot press for as a 'requirement' of it but surely is a point ignored by the media gaints themselves when in the race to sustain)

- The 'individuals' who are amazed by the 'opportunities available'(as promoted by the media) form their opinions by conforming to those 'standards set by some others (the media)' and lessen their individual pursuits(normal for those who are relying on media to learn the world around them while ignoring the underlying ideas of 'that media' in spreading the news)

While everyone seems to be normal as for their stands the conceptions are inherently - (as pointed out by the above mentioned article) lessening the chances for 'moving towards a sustainable ecosystem". Can we say that the Indian IT industry is striving 'to be a better slave' than it was yesterday?

2. About the stars/brands, casteism:
Our 'obsession' for brands and stars was rightly pointed out wherein the current advertisements (many of them) seem obviously ridiculous with the 'stars' doing irrelevant feats/movements in support of a product.

The 'casteism' appears all of a sudden in an article speaking of IT. It seems plausible that this idea of 'only a few kinds(?) of people are supposed to "do" few things while the rest are not supposed to "try" at all for something else is inherently crippling the minds of people. (Well, great point to speak against/completely ignore the 'castes') The 'ground-breaking' examples being called for (in the article) are worth thinking of.
