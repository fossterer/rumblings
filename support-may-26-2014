10:04																					glob	       (or yesterday)
10:04																					fossterer      uhh.. I added that to Persona out of desperation.. that created an account
10:04																						       glob nukes it
10:04																						       fossterer  Can I delete its account at bugzilla?
10:05																						       glob	  no, but i can one moment
10:05																						       fossterer  
10:05																						       glob	  The following changes have been made to the user account shashank16392@gmail.com:
10:05																						       glob	  The login is now shashank@linux.com.
10:05																						       fossterer  Awesome!
10:05																						       fossterer  wait..

10:07																						       fossterer  Woww! Thank you very much
10:07																						       glob	  i can catch that though... yeah; if you accidentally do that now, you'll be told to log in as your @linux.com account
10:08																						       fossterer  I didn't expect you to be so prompt
10:08																						       fossterer  Thank you once again!
10:08																						       glob	  no worries
10:08																						       fossterer  One more thing..

10:09																						       glob	  hrm
10:09																						       glob	  it shouldn't :|
10:10																						       glob	  looks right to me -- i see no activity on that account
10:10																						       glob	  is this via 'my dashboard' ?
10:11																						       glob	  (i see 4 bugs assigned to shashank@linux.com)
10:11																						       fossterer  Fine.. that must be a delay.. I logged out and logged in .. all good now!
10:11																						       glob	  hey, four bugs is excellent!
10:11																						       glob	  do you want the ability to assign bugs to yourself?
10:12																						       fossterer  Hahha.. thanks .. that now I am doing something I wanted to make sure all fall under unique login..
10:12																						       fossterer  hence only this desperation
10:12																						       fossterer  ohh..
