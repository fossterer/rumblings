About my site:
---------------

Who & how should one read this?
http://think-like-a-git.net/ <-- This site puts it right.

In a similar spirit, I tell you these:

 - When you ask me to refer you a site, I intend you to know that it is a good "starting point"
 - It is your job to start from there, go around their 'Introduction' pages, 'About' pages to better appreciate why it caught my fancy
 - Whenever you find a reference/link in those pages, "it is your next point of reference that I might be subliminally refererring to" and as they might be too many in number for me to just replicate here in my pages (not that I mind but I prefer referring to the actual authors who bring me delight and forwarding you to my first sources of information)/ there is so much for you to look at in that site than *just those links*

General Points (Not necessarily about this site; a reminder list for me too :) ):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Being a developer, it's not about **you**; it's about the project you are working on/ the IRC channel you are lurking in (Initial lines of https://wiki.gnome.org/Community/GettingInTouch/IRC)
