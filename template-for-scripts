#The following script template was not written by me

A template file to use when writing shell scripts.

The trap statement emits an error if a command fails. Without the trap and the -e, it is easy for the script to quit early without you realizing it.

#!/bin/bash -e

trap '
SAVEDSTATUS=$?
set +x
if [ x$CLEANEXIT = x ]
then
echo "$0: ERROR Unexpected exit with return value of $SAVEDSTATUS"
exit $SAVEDSTATUS
fi' EXIT
