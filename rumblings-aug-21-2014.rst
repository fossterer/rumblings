How to understand Networking protocols better at college?
----------------------------------------------------------

Situation: While I was first taught 'Networking Protocols', I couldn't understand what the block-like diagrams describing 'message formats' meant. Now after many years fo looking at them and while I work in a Networks lab, I see more comprehensive resources that could have been introduced to me earlier to amke my learning at that time smooth.

Don't forget to know about the RFCs listed below such pages. Slowly transform yourself into reading those RFCs directly (HINT: They are made available by IETF)
