IDEA:
-----

	To design a pop-up window blocker (stress on "window" blocker) which is fine with ads on the side of browser. We're concerned of only the annoying pop-up/pop-under windows.

	Mozilla Firefox currently provides a 'Block pop-up windows autoatically' yet a few websites manage to display their pop-up/pop-under windows. For POCs, see "Pictures/pop-up-windows-[1.png,2-3.mp4]". I would have to get into the codebase for this pop-up blocker and --
*	First, hardcode the URLs of pop=up windows
*	Next, generalisse the approach

Approach:
---------

	This night, I'm grepping (at mxr.mozilla.org) to find the appropriate codebase and analyse the code.
	Tomorrow, I would be contacting people over IRC

Thoughts:
----------

Today I was reading about Frederich Nietzsche --
"... and argues that KÃ¶hler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.[122]"
