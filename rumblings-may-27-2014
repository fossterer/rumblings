Idea :
-------
Any notification (WhatsApp, SMS, Voice Call etc.) should fire a notification on my Ubuntu Desktop.

Intention:
----------
The user should not feel disturbed needing to unlock his/her phone and look at.. only to find that the notification is non-urgent



Idea :
-------
Setup a web-page highlighter that allows your higlights on a web page to be shareable

Note:
------
The URL of the page should explicitly show the original URL.
Cache the page in your server so that any updates to the original page or URL don't disturb you:
      Than caching the entire page, find the line no./pixel position OR
      	   more inteliigently, the HTML <p> no.
