Just browsing through #mobile IRC channel.
AaronMT posted some link to 'A meeting notes'. Wanted to see what's there in the meeting. Unexpected!!! My name (NOT fossterer; it's "Shashank")

I was not expecting this at all!

NOTE:   I see that the fix mentioned there is a minor one of all I've been doing. This must be a way of encouragement by the Mozilla team. :)
