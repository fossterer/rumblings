Why sudo is dangerous? (I'm not answering this here)
----------------------------------------------------

Always paid no heed to sysadmins who advise don't always use sudo, it's dangerous? Well this is for you; an incident reported in a Google+ post ( and obviously searching for that command mentioned in Google got me more information about such incidents"

Hello, I need some help. #Linux   #Ubuntu  
I wrongly type "sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/lib" in the terminal and now the command "sudo" cannot be used any more.
What should I do? How do I recover it to the originality?ï»¿

I do it because that's how I always did thigns. By doing them without a doubt I learnt something or the other. In the process I excel; I improve myself in one manner or the other. I do it because that makes me happy; that motivates me; that excites me; that introduces me to newer avenues
