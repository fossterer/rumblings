Why I'm giving up my Facebook presence
-----------------------------------------

Simply because, I don't want a company (meh!) to define what my "privacy" should be. Changing it every week.. what? To align with whose? of 3million+ members? I don't see any point.. I quit!

[Agreeing with that ted video guy - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOE1HFEL8XA&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbOE1HFEL8XA

No!! Surely facebook has introduced me to new groups.. new friends.. Atheist pages, Idealist pages, Conspiracy Syndrome, GeekyIndians 2.0 (and the link to this video from this page) and more but..

* I don't want to be in a bubble..
    -- I need different viewpoints.. not just an agreeing bunch of people
* I hate to be decided by "Algorithms" what to see.. I don't want to be decided with regards to the information that I am seeking to know at any given time
