My Submission 1:
string_in = str(raw_input())
string_out = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in string_in.split())
print string_out

Passed only 2 of 6 testcases!

Hints from discussion: "You need to preserve spaces!"

OMG! Do I have to use regex or other stuff that I don't know????!?!?!?

Finally this worked!

My Submission 1:
string_in = str(raw_input())
string_out = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in string_in.split(' '))
print string_out


Just made 'split()' as 'split(' ')' and it preserved spaces! Yayy!!
