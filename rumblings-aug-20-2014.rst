If there's one thing that I should say about the lessons learned today (resulting from the uncertainities about my progress for 4 days), it is --

    " Respect the rules of the language you are using!!! "

Why do I say it?

   " Because, working inside the NS-3 environment is alright, while obeying its rules. But the supporting C++ requires you to 'declare' a function header before 'defining' it it...

     Never ignore 'declaration' before 'definition'! "
