jned: I have a disk utility that shows my disk health, what is the program name to install it on another computer. When I do about it just says red hat disk utility
dvs: smartmontools?
 - Rosco2 has disconnected (Quit: Leaving)
jned: dvs, thx, I think it might gnome-disk-utility
Ghost_In_Zshell: It's not gnome-disk-utility?
jned: Ghost_In_Zshell, thx
zykotick9: dvs: while Ghost_In_Zshell is "correct" in this case - i think you gave the "right" answer ;-)
 - okao has disconnected (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
jned: When I run the disk utility it shows me: SMART Status: DISK FAILURE IS IMMINENT
Ghost_In_Zshell: That's ominous.
dvs: so.......?
fossterer: hi ! If I install Mozilla Firefox by downloading .deb, do I get updates regularly? - on debian

zykotick9: fossterer: NO
 - sylencecc has joined the room

Ghost_In_Zshell: Depends. If it's bad blocks - fsck?

sylencecc: hi! after upgrading my debian installation to recent testing, some fonts aren't working anymore. i installed the artwiz fonts a while ago (bitmap fonts), they show up in fc-list and in programs like inkscape, but they just look like Sans...andy idea? bitmap fonts are enabled.
fossterer: What if I added their ppa to sources.list?
jned: dvs, thx, and what other cases are there?
zykotick9: fossterer: ppa in sources.list - oh man you're in for trouble...
jned: dvs, so it's dead eh
dvs: yup\
jned: Ghost_In_Zshell, , thx, and what other cases are there?
 - antonp has disconnected (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
fossterer: zykotick9: But why?
jned: its wierd, cause, the option to check and repair disks is only available when you mounted, but when you try to run that option it says resource busy
zykotick9: jned: i agree with dvs - if smartmontools is saying "failure imminent", expect it to fail!

zykotick9: fossterer: PPAs are for ubuntu, yet you are asking in #debian.  what Distro are you using?
jned: zykotick9, yeah true, its already failing, but no way to fix it now, its garbage eh
Ghost_In_Zshell: jned: Well my hard-coded reaction to seeing imminent failure reports from SMART is to rsync /home and /etc to a backup and Amazon Prime myself a new drive.
crash_: i had debian wheezy and xfce as desktop environment, but i upgraded to testing and now gnome has taking everything over.
zykotick9: crash_: s/upgraded/transitioned/
jned: Ghost_In_Zshell, I already backup what I could, I would just like to fix it if I could
jned: crash_, gnome is awesome, I was sticking with xfce4 for while but gnome is great if you have a working graphics ddriver
fossterer: zykotick9: ohh.. My bad! I was using Ubuntu for the last 2 years.. So I called it that way... I turned to Debian a week ago :-)
 - halu_ has disconnected (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
 - antonp has joined the room
zykotick9: fossterer: well, rule #1 debian != ubuntu
fossterer: zykotick9: Then what is its equivalent in debian? I mean adding to sources.list
crash_: jned, yeah i got nothing against gnome, but i had xfce and i would prefer if that is the one that boots up instead of gnome :-)
fossterer: zykotick9: More rules please...
zykotick9: fossterer: thankfully, there isn't a direct equivalant right now
jned: crash_, just remove gnome then
fossterer: So I can't add third-party repos?
crash_: jned, yeah that is a way todo it :-P
 - relix has disconnected (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
jned: crash_, also, gdm3 or even lightdm should select the previously selected desktp environment as your default, so if you log in once to xfce, it will do the same second time
crash_: jned, if i choose xfce4 it still boots up gnome instead of xfce4
 - Ghost_In_Zshell has disconnected (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
zykotick9: fossterer: you can, but it's NOT debian.  and it's NOT a good idea.
 - okao has joined the room
jned: crash_, yeah right, wierd, cause they both use the same something on the low lever or somethig eh, but I can boot into xfce4 here no problem, not sure what happen over there, what display manager?
 - relix has joined the room
elvora: df 0kh
crash_: jned, i'm using lightdm, but i will try to remove gnome instead, that should fix it.
jned: crash_, or you can install gdm3
jned: or you can manually set the default with lightdm
crash_: jned, ok thanks i will try to thinker and see if i can fix it :-)

fossterer: ayotick9: What about videos at Youtube.. ?
fossterer: I tried to keep gnash as is for 2 weeks and gave up yesterday :-(
arthurfiggis: fossterer: i migrated over to debian stable from ubuntu about a week and a half ago myself as well...not too difficult at all really :-) and despite the battering that gnome 3 gets, it does have a very good screen reader installation
fossterer: got a new friend! :-D
arthurfiggis: (you'll find  that a lot of videos on youtube are actually html5 compatible now as well though, so in a lot of cases you don't need the flash plugin for those any more)
zykotick9: fossterer: is ayotick9 me?  try TAB complietion.  YouTube "kinda" works with html5/gnash - but i'd say most videos DON'T play with my setup.  I'm obviously a "free" software guy as well, in part for reason already given.

zykotick9: fossterer: you might want to see "/msg dpkg irssi" before deciding ;-)

fossterer: zykotick9: *LOL*
themill: fossterer: debian is quite conservative about forcing new versions at users. New versions require new libraries and that can (and does) have unwelcome consequences for other applications.
arthurfiggis: zykotick9: oh that's absolutely true yes, i probably should have made that clear as well sorry :-) i was just offering my own experience on doing so, if you do try it, it's not so hard to get running

zykotick9: !tell fossterer about frankendebian
 - dvheumen_ has joined the room
bezaban: you can put 'wheezy' (currently stable) or 'stable' in /etc/apt/sources.list, this will define what version you run
dvs: Dont put stable!
bezaban: nope
zykotick9: fossterer: i'd suggest not getting too excited about testing/unstable(aka sid) if i where you.  and DON'T mix releases... please.  BUT with Debian, you "can" do anything you want.  but so much is "not a good idea".
fossterer: **LOL*** Frankendebian.. funny play on the name!!
bezaban: but that's the only case where it will 'force upgrade' you
zykotick9: foobArrr: see "/msg dkpg ssb" for the "proper" way to backport stuff yourself from sid.
bezaban: fortress_: the other debian versions are kept up to date, so you will get continous updates by doing apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
bezaban: but the branches generally update every second year
bezaban: ie. change status
bezaban: isn't there a factoid about versions? :-S
bezaban: !version
dpkg: Kernel: uname -r, or cat /proc/version.  Package: dpkg -l _pkgname_ , or run apt-cache policy <packagename>.  Miscellaneous commands: try --version on the command.  For the version of Debian, ask me about <debian suite>.

bezaban: current testing is 'jessie'
zykotick9: bezaban: security updates to stable - are basically, the best available on any gnu/linux platform!  but don't expect "version" updates on anything!  see "/msg dpkg stable"
themill: fossterer: you'd probably do better spending some time learning your way around debian before you upgrade to testing.
