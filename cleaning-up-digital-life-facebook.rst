The prime objects in Facebook is 'Friends'. Starting out with the list of Friends -
  - Categorize each friend into one and only one 'List'
  NOTE: You may not get the list of friends shown the same way everytime you go to this page. So finish this task at one go!
    - A sub step: Organize (create, rename or delete) the lists you have first
      - Scroll down till you see 'Friends' on the left hand side while on your 'News Feed' and click 'More'
      - Click one each 'list name' and choose 'manage' to delete or rename lists
      - Click on 'Create List' to create a new one.
	- In my case, I prefer to have one list for each section of my life. eg: family, <my-school-name>-friends, <my-school-name>-lecturers, <my-college-name>-friends, <my-college-name>-juniors, <my-college-name>-seniors, <my-college-name>-lecturers and so on.
	- Such a caegorization allows us to apply differnt 'Privacy Settings' to each of them and allows us to quickly post a message to precise targets while not spamming others
	- Out of (artificial, though) intelligence, Facebook itself creates a few lists with places I lived in and added my friends into it automatically. This might be fine but it conflicts with my line of thought. So I remove all my friends from Facebook's auto-generated lists and choose 'Archive List' from 'Manage List'. (Obviously, I'd have been happier if I had 'Delete List' here)

	- Another approach would be first removing everyone from Facebook's auto-generated lists, then archiving them and finding out what list each friend belongs to - A nice game to check who of all those 500+ friends you actually remeber! If you can't recall, message them explaining your task - an interesting way for both of you to reconnect.

	- I am half way there, removing my friends from Facebook's auto-generated lists and I found at least one in each list whose 'profile has been deleted'!
	- This is why I dislike your 'Custom Lists', Facebook - A few of my friends listed their college name in a shortened form while others took efforts list the entire name and now you show me 5 lists (yeah, there're 4 semi-shortened forms to the name of our college) of different friends while they all should be in a single list
	
    - Now that lists are organized, While still there, click on 'See all Friends' to the right of 'Create a List'

    - Hover on each friend's name and then hover on the box with 'Friends (and a tick mark)' and click on 'Add to another list...'

    - Check only those lists that they fit into - If (s)he went to both school and college with you, check on both lists
      NOTE: We're going by the assumption that this friend who occurs in both lists won't mess up your (digital)life by leaking what you posted in one list into another.
      However, if the person likes/comments on one post you made while in one list, the post gets exposed to his/her friends.
      If you don't want to deal with all these complexities, stick to this:
      "If you have atleast one person who you don't want to see a thing, don't post it anywhere at all just in a run for Likes & Shares"  --  Very simple and always works
