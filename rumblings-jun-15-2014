IDEA:
-----

Have all contact no.s in 'Contacts' with country codes.
     *	 Any entry in contacts should allow itself to  be swiped to be dialled
     *	 If the user is allowed to make ISD calls, start Dialer
     *	 Else, invoke the appropriate app which the user might have available in the system/ registered with this Contacts app.

Design Issues:
--------------

Should this new functionality be implemeneted int 'Contacts' space or'Dialler' space?
