How to get sources of 'gnome-screenshot' so that I can work with them?

 - From apt-get source?
 - From launchpad/other sources?

Where can I ask?

 - IRC?
 - 'gnome-screenshot' project page? OR wiki?


Things I learnt (more) today:
------------------------------

- Read the output of a "make" command. It tells you where the 'final executable' is
  - While the Debian's (Upstream) packages are copied as they are by Ubuntu (Downstream), the Ubuntu-specific (Downstream-specific) changes reside inside  -
"gnome-screenshot-3.10.1/debian/patches/" (for the package 'gnome-screenshot').
