A few people may be proficient in directing movies but not as efficient when it comes to dialogue/monologue designing. No one is expected to stay rotten in their present position as it is cheating their inherent human capabilities but should strive a bit more until the newly being exposed skill is effective. It doesn't mean that they should stop exploring new horizons but still I comment because I know that the receiver knows that the criticism too is a way of appreciating some other's work but from their own point of view rather than the one of the original worker. In fact this comment comes after being hit in face by stupendous and exhilarating narration in one of his earlier movies but presented with a sub-standard and too commonplace in the new seriouly expected mov(i)e.

Now being in his own shoes (which I enjoy truthfully), I question the author of this post - "Who asked you to comment on some work which you yourself are not capable of at all?"; "Why do you bother about writing somthing which you don't like?" and make a few satirical remarks like - "People so free to comment on my work don't interest me"; "I don't care an attention seeker's uninteresting musings" and many more which I (the real 'me') can't think as being someone different from the original owner of these shoes.

I hope (not really) my ideas behind this post are clear ( I doubt..:) ) by now showing that I am only seeking attention as a die-hard lover of the ideas of the original show owner (:P) but in the process am not being a conformist to that teacher who himself hates such personality calling it the stop signal to the human thinking capabilities.

(Written in discontent to the narration in this movie trailer - "Heyy, Stop! What movie?" I know that you know that...)
